# Processing and visualizing data with Rust

## Polars
[Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) is an alternative to the famous pandas data library that is used in Python. Polars is also a python library, but written in Rust! That means we can also use the library in Rust. The example in [main.rs](src/main.rs) does not do much in terms of data processing, maybe experiment with it. Give it a try!

## Plotlars
[Plotlars](https://github.com/alceal/plotlars) is a simple library that acts as a bridge between Polars and Plotly.js to provide easy access to plots.

## Example
The example uses a dataset with lots of penguins. There is also [assets_m6.csv](assets_m6.csv). Can you find out what it's about? Can you see any characteristics?
